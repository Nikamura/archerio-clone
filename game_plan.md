# Archer.io Web Clone: Complete Development Plan

The Archero-style roguelike shooter succeeds through a deceptively simple core mechanic: **stop to shoot, move to dodge**. This creates a fundamental tension between offense and defense that drives the entire game experience. Building a web-based clone requires carefully layering complexity onto this foundation without breaking what makes it work. This plan structures development into three fully playable versions, each complete and polished before moving forward.

## The core loop that makes Archero work

The game's brilliance lies in splitting control: the player handles movement via virtual joystick while the game handles aiming and shooting automatically. When the player releases the joystick to stop moving, their character auto-fires at the nearest enemy. This creates **100+ micro-decisions per minute**—every moment of stillness is a calculated risk. According to design analyses, this mechanic achieves "the right amount of control and agency" while remaining "truly hyper-casual."

The roguelike layer compounds this with run-based ability selection. Every level-up presents three random abilities (multishot, ricochet, elemental damage), and smart combinations create exponential power growth. Players who die lose their abilities but keep permanent progression—equipment, hero levels, and talent upgrades persist. This dual-loop (run-based skills + permanent meta-progression) drives both session engagement and long-term retention.

## Technical foundation: Phaser.js architecture

**Recommended stack:**
- **Engine:** Phaser 3.6+ with Arcade Physics (significantly faster than Matter.js for this genre)
- **Touch controls:** nipplejs for virtual joystick + phaser3-rex-plugins as backup
- **ECS (optional):** bitECS for 1000+ entity management, though standard OOP works for MVP
- **Build:** Vite or Webpack with tree-shaking

**Critical performance requirements:**
- Object pooling for all bullets, enemies, and particles (pre-allocate 100+ bullets)
- Single texture atlas under 4096x4096 for mobile compatibility
- Target 60 FPS desktop, 30-60 FPS mobile
- Under 100 draw calls per frame

```javascript
// Core pattern: Object pool for bullets
class BulletPool extends Phaser.Physics.Arcade.Group {
  constructor(scene) {
    super(scene.physics.world, scene, {
      classType: Bullet,
      maxSize: 100,
      runChildUpdate: true
    });
  }
  spawn(x, y, angle, speed) {
    const bullet = this.get(x, y);
    if (bullet) bullet.fire(x, y, angle, speed);
    return bullet;
  }
}
```

## MVP: Minimum playable core loop

**Goal:** A complete, fun 5-minute game session demonstrating the stop-to-shoot mechanic with basic progression. A player should be able to pick it up, understand it instantly, and want to play again.

### MVP features (4-6 weeks solo development)

**Core movement and combat:**
- Virtual joystick spawns at touch point (entire left half of screen)
- Player auto-fires when stationary, stops firing when moving
- Auto-aim targets nearest enemy with simple distance calculation
- Single weapon type: basic bow with moderate speed
- Projectiles use object pooling with off-screen recycling

**Three enemy archetypes:**
| Enemy | Behavior | Attack |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Melee Rusher | Moves directly toward player | Contact damage |
| Ranged Shooter | Stops periodically, fires at player | Single projectile with red telegraph line |
| Spreader | Stationary, fires 4-direction pattern | Slow projectiles |

**Level structure:**
- 10 rooms per run (linear progression)
- Room-based: clear all enemies → door opens → next room
- Room 5: Angel choice (heal 30% HP OR gain ability)
- Room 10: Boss fight (larger enemy with 3 attack patterns)
- Run ends on death or boss defeat

**Ability system (simplified):**
- Level up every 10 kills (3 level-ups per run typical)
- Choose from 3 abilities per level-up
- **MVP ability pool (8 abilities):**
  - Front Arrow +1 (-25% damage)
  - Multishot (-15% attack speed)
  - Attack Speed Boost (+25%)
  - Attack Boost (+30%)
  - Piercing Shot (through enemies, -33% per enemy)
  - Ricochet (bounces 3x between enemies)
  - Fire Damage (18% weapon damage over 2 seconds)
  - Crit Boost (+10% crit chance, +40% crit damage)

**Basic HUD:**
- Health bar (top-left, green → red)
- XP bar (below health)
- Room counter (top-center: "3/10")
- Pause button (top-right)
- Boss health bar (full-width, appears in boss room)

**MVP UI screens:**
- Main menu: Play button, settings toggle
- Level-up modal: 3 ability cards, darkened background
- Death screen: "Try Again" button, basic stats (rooms cleared, enemies killed)
- Victory screen: Run complete message, restart button

**Procedural generation (minimal):**
- 5 hand-crafted room layouts per room type (combat, boss)
- Random enemy spawn positions within layouts
- Weighted random ability selection
- Seeded randomness for reproducibility

**What MVP deliberately excludes:**
No equipment, no persistent progression, no currencies, no hero selection, no ads, no complex menus. The MVP tests whether the core loop is fun.

## Development priorities and risk mitigation

**What to prototype first:**
1. Virtual joystick + auto-aim (if this doesn't feel good, nothing else matters)
2. Stop-to-shoot timing (test different response delays: 0ms, 50ms, 100ms)
3. Enemy telegraph visibility (red lines must be readable on all backgrounds)
4. Ability selection modal (core engagement moment)

**Common failure modes:**
- **Performance death spiral:** Too many particles, too many enemies → frame drops → joystick lag → player frustration. Budget entities strictly.
- **Ability power creep:** Abilities must stack meaningfully but not trivialize content. Test 20+ minute runs with maximum ability counts.
- **Currency economy collapse:** Model expected play time to key milestones. If players can max equipment in 2 weeks, retention dies.
- **Touch target failures:** Test on actual phones, not browser emulators. Minimum 44px touch targets.

**Recommended testing cadence:**
- MVP: Daily playtest sessions, 10+ external playtesters before V1
- V1: Closed beta with 100+ players, metrics on session length, progression speed
- V2: Soft launch in limited markets (Canada, Australia), optimize before global

## Phaser.js implementation patterns

**Scene structure:**

```javascript
// Recommended scene organization
const scenes = [
  BootScene,      // Load core assets
  PreloaderScene, // Load game assets with progress bar
  MainMenuScene,  // Menu navigation
  GameScene,      // Core gameplay
  UIScene,        // HUD overlay (runs parallel to GameScene)
  PauseScene,     // Pause overlay
  ResultsScene    // Victory/defeat
];
```

**Ability component pattern:**

```javascript
class AbilityManager {
  constructor(player) {
    this.player = player;
    this.abilities = [];
  }

  addAbility(abilityType) {
    const existing = this.abilities.find(a => a.type === abilityType);
    if (existing) {
      existing.stack(); // Abilities can stack
    } else {
      this.abilities.push(AbilityFactory.create(abilityType, this.player));
    }
    this.recalculateStats();
  }

  modifyProjectile(projectile) {
    // Each ability can modify projectiles
    for (const ability of this.abilities) {
      ability.onProjectileFired?.(projectile);
    }
  }
}
```

**Room transition pattern:**

```javascript
onRoomCleared() {
  // Fade out
  this.cameras.main.fadeOut(300);
  
  this.time.delayedCall(300, () => {
    this.currentRoom++;
    
    if (this.currentRoom % 5 === 0) {
      this.spawnAngel(); // Every 5th room
    } else if (this.currentRoom === this.totalRooms) {
      this.spawnBoss();
    } else {
      this.generateCombatRoom();
    }
    
    this.cameras.main.fadeIn(300);
  });
}
```

## Timeline summary

| Phase | Duration | Deliverable |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| MVP | 4-6 weeks | Core loop playable, 10-room runs, 8 abilities |
| V1 | 6-10 weeks | Full progression, 5 chapters, equipment, 3 heroes |
| V2 | 8-12 weeks | Monetization, social, 10 chapters, 8 heroes |
| **Total** | **18-28 weeks** | Production-ready F2P roguelike shooter |

Each version is a complete, shippable game. MVP could be released as a jam game or proof-of-concept. V1 is a full indie release. V2 is a live-service product with revenue potential. The key is resisting the urge to add V1 features during MVP—ship each milestone before expanding scope.
